# Issue Process

The number one skill here is empathy. Am I treating people nice? Do I have reasonable expectations of others? Am I using other people's time efficiently? Can I anticipate questions and answer them before anyone asks?


## Issue Checklist

Ask yourself these questions when creating a new issue:

  * [ ] Is your title as clear and specific as possible?
  * [ ] Did you include a minimal, reproducable example? Is it an [SSCCE][sscce]?
  * [ ] What OS and browser are you using? What versions?
  * [ ] What version of Elm are you using?
  * [ ] Is there anything weird about your computer we should know?
  * [ ] How long would it take for a reader to figure out what you are trying to say? Can it be less time?
  * [ ] Will a reader spend a lot of time building or installing things? Can this be avoided?

Sometimes you cannot do all of these, and that is totally fine! Still open the issue, but make a note about what is missing and ask for help.

## Issue Participation

You are about to comment on an issue. Before you do, consider these facts.


#### Issues are for work

Issues are for discussing a technical problem. What is the root cause? What code
may be related? Can we find other [SSCCE][sscce]'s that help us understand the problem?

You are derailing an issue if you are:

  * **Sharing opinions** &mdash; Opinions are easy to have and *feel* helpful, but they
    pretty much always slow down an issue.
  * **Voting** &mdash; Adding a "+1" or "I want this too" is actively not helpful.
    Prioritization is not a democracy, and even if it was, counting +1's is not
    a good way to get a representative sample.
  * **Broadening the issue** &mdash; Keeping issues focused is extremely difficult.
    If you want to talk about a bigger issue that is raised, open a new issue. Do not
    hijack an issue!

This stuff is fun and easy, but it makes *work* harder by making the thread
longer and less focused. So when you are about to comment, ask yourself:
**does the person fixing this issue need to read this?** Am I using their
time efficiently?


#### Longer issues are harder to understand

> I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time. &mdash; Blaise Pascal

Most of the ways of derailing a thread are things that make a thread longer
but do not advance the core goal. Even if OP is very disciplined, one person
can massively grow threads.

Here's the problem:

  * Every issue must be distilled down to a core problem that fits in a person's brain. If you do not do that distilling, someone else has to!
  * Easy issues will naturally be resolved faster. The more work the reader must do to help, the less likely you are to get help super quick.

So to use everyone else's time most efficiently, *you* have to distill things. If you do this, more people will be able to help and you will have better outcomes in aggregate!
