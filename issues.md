# Issue Process

The number one skill here is empathy. Am I treating people nice? Do I have reasonable expectations of others? Am I using other people's time efficiently? Can I anticipate questions and answer them before anyone asks?


## Issue Checklist

Ask yourself these questions when creating a new issue:

  * [ ] Is your title as clear and specific as possible?
  * [ ] Did you include a minimal, reproducable example? Is it an [SSCCE][sscce]?
  * [ ] What OS and browser are you using? What versions?
  * [ ] What version of Elm are you using?
  * [ ] Is there anything weird about your computer we should know?
  * [ ] How long would it take for a reader to figure out what you are trying to say? Can it be less time?
  * [ ] Will a reader spend a lot of time building or installing things? Can this be avoided?

Sometimes you cannot do all of these, and that is totally fine! Still open the issue, but make a note about what is missing and ask for help.

## Issue Participation

When you are about to comment, ask yourself: do the people fixing this issue need this information? **Am I using their time efficiently?** The following points refine exactly what that means.


#### Long issues are hard to understand

> I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time. &mdash; Blaise Pascal

Understanding a 10 comment discussion is quite difficult. If this happens to a thread, it makes sense to:

  1. Revise the original post to capture all the new information.
  2. Close the issue and open a new one that captures all the new information.

Either way works. If you want to do this but do not have enough admin priveledges, just ask a collaborator to get you added for curation abilities.


#### Broad issues are less successful

The best issues are very narrowly focused. I want to do X, and everyone focuses on X. What is the root cause? What code may be related? Can we find other [SSCCE][sscce]'s that help us understand the problem? In these issues, “success” is very obvious because X is resolved.

There are many kinds of comments that make it harder to have a “successful” result.

  * **Sharing opinions** &mdash; Opinions are easy to have, but if they cannot be refined into a concrete technical concern it is probably better to save it. This is a fuzzy line, so maybe callibrate your judgement by watching how the thread evolves from your comment and seeing who, if anyone, follows up.
  * **Voting** &mdash; Commenting with "+1" is not helpful. Prioritization is not a democracy, and even if it was, counting +1's is not a good way to get a representative vote. If you have a specific personal experience like “this blocks me from doing Y”, that *can* be helpful if the broader implications of the issue were not clear otherwise.
  * **Broadening** &mdash; Sometimes an issue points to a broader question. If so, open a *new* issue about that specifically and point back to the issue that inspired it. This way each one stays more focused can be handled independently. This way complex topics become a network of well-defined ideas, rather than one big glob of discussion.

Part of the problem with all of these is simply that they make threads longer.

Now you cannot retroactively stop people from doing any of these things, but you *can* use your comments to recover focus. **If a comment is getting off-topic, just pretend it did not happen.** This is a surprisingly effective technique for keeping things on track.


#### Experiment with your behavior

None of these points should discourage you from commenting or helping with something. The only way to improve is to mess up. I mean that literally. Every skill I have in online communication comes from making public and embarassing mistakes! It always feels like a big deal at the time, but ultimately no one else remembers and you come out with skills that make things smoother and more fun for everyone.

**So just try things out, and be reflective!** If no one engages with the comment, try something else. If someone tells you that X is disruptive or distracting, take it as a data point. Folks on the internet always *sound* extra mean, but they are almost always trying to make things better and more fun. So try to separate the emotions from the actual concern. If you find that people are engaged with you and happy to talk, do more of that!
