# Issue Process

The number one skill here is empathy. Am I treating people nice? Do I have reasonable expectations of others? Am I using other people's time efficiently? Folks are trying to make cool stuff and have fun, and everything works better if you are too!


## Issue Checklist

Ask yourself these questions when creating a new issue:

  * Is your title as clear and specific as possible?
  * Did you include a minimal, reproducable example? Is it an [SSCCE][sscce]?
  * What OS and browser are you using? What versions?
  * What version of Elm are you using?
  * Is there anything weird about your computer we should know?
  * How long would it take for a reader to figure out what you are trying to say? Can it be less time?
  * Will a reader spend a lot of time building or installing things? Can this be avoided?

Sometimes you cannot do all of these, and that is totally fine! Still open the
issue, but make a note about what is missing and ask for help.

## Issue Participation

You are about to comment on an issue. Before you do, consider these facts.


#### Longer issues are harder to understand


#### Issues are for work

Issues are for discussing a technical problem. What is the root cause? What code
may be related? What are the different possible fixes? What are the objective
trade offs? What concrete tasks need to be performed?

You are derailing an issue if you are:

  * **Sharing opinions** &mdash; Opinions are easy to have and *feel* helpful, but they
    pretty much always slow down an issue.
  * **Voting** &mdash; Adding a "+1" or "I want this too" is actively not helpful.
    Prioritization is not a democracy, and even if it was, counting +1's is not
    a good way to get a representative sample.

This stuff is fun and easy, but it makes *work* harder by making the thread
longer and less focused. So when you are about to comment, ask yourself:
**does the person fixing this issue need to read this?** Am I using their
time efficiently?
