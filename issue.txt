Hi, I am a robot that helps currate issues. Thanks for creating this one!

My human colleagues are easily confused, so please see if you did everything on the [issue checklist][checklist]. Just edit the title or description *directly* if you need to add more info.

If you are going to comment, keep [these things][participation] in mind! And everyone should have [clear expectations][expectations] about how issues go.
