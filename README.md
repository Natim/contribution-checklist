# The Process

**Goal:** Define clear “rules of engagement” for issues, pull requests, and design discussions.

Collaborating on open source projects is tough! Often folks want to help, but there is a whole set of communication skills that you must learn to be really effective and have the most fun.

This repo distills these learnings into guidelines for:

  * [issues](issues.md)
  * [pull requests](pulls.md)

A robot named [process-bot](https://github.com/process-bot) reads GitHub
issues and tries to help folks follow these guidelines!
