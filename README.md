# The Process

**Goal:** Define clear “rules of engagement” for issues, pull requests, and design discussions.

Collaborating on open source projects is tough! Often folks want to help, but there is a whole set of communication skills that you must learn to be really effective and have the most fun.

This document distills these learnings into **The Process** for:

  * [issues](issues.md)
  * pull requests
  * design discussions
