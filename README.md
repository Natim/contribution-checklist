# Contribution Checklist

Creating great issues and pull requests is actually kind of tricky. Even folks who are super experienced forget important details sometimes! So whether you are opening your first issue or your hundreth, be sure to go through the relevant checklist:

  * [Issue Checklist](issues.md)
  * [Pull Request Checklist](pulls.md)

From there, it is important to know [what to expect](expectations.md) and [how to participate](participation.md).

Normally no one would ever find this repo, so a robot named [process-bot](https://github.com/process-bot) wanders around telling people about it.
