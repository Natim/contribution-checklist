# The Process

Collaborating on open source projects is tough! Often folks want to help, but there is a whole set of communication skills that you must learn to be really effective and have the most fun.

This repo distills some successful patterns of thought and behavior into guidelines for:

  * [issues](issues.md)
  * [pull requests](pulls.md)
  * [expectations](expectations.md)

A robot named [process-bot](https://github.com/process-bot) reads GitHub issues and tries to help folks follow these guidelines!
