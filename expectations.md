# Expectations

The easiest way to have more fun in open source is to know what to expect from The Process! This page outlines a few things that can seem frustrating, but make sense when you see the bigger picture.


## “Simple” Problems

If something “simple” is taking a long time, there is probably a good reason. It probably means:

  1. It is more complicated than it seems. Maybe it makes weird assumptions or interacts with something else in a bad way.
  2. To explain why it is complicated may take longer than just fixing it.
  3. The overall prioritization of work across the entire project means that “the best option” is to circle back to the issue at a later date.

The third one is the most insidious because it means a medium complexity issue in `core` can get blocked by an unrelated revamp of `elm-package`. Issues are resolved most efficiently when you can spend one or two solid days focused on the relevant repo, so this “batching” often means that the fastest *overall* outcome means individual items may stall for a while.

So things can hibernate for a bunch of reasons, but do not get discouraged! It seems that this is a natural part of The Process, and the best thing to do is to try something else until it is unblocked!


## Results

A lot of folks think that a successful result implies that a change got merged really quickly. This is a self-defeating mindset, especially considering that a very small fraction of changes *should* be merged in the first place. The statistics set you up for “failure” as defined by this metric.

A healthier mindset is to see these things as personal projects. Can I work on something fun? Can I learn some new ideas? Try out a cool technique? Can I start to learn a large codebase with an eye towards making bigger changes or just to learn how to make something big of my own? Can I teach other people the interesting things I learned? Can I set other people up to do a better job?

This way of thinking makes things a lot nicer if you have a hibernating pull request (blocked on prioritization or something). You have explored an implementation strategy. Possibly the right one ultimately. When prioritization changes, someone will show up to a great PR and be really grateful for your work!


## Tone / Relationships

It can be really frustrating when things are going slow. Maybe no one is replying to you or things seem stalled. 100% of people who do open source work experience this.

One natural way to handle this is get mad at people. Unfortunately, this is very likely to make things worse. No one wants to get yelled at by an internet stranger at their hobby or side-project. So they won't! They do not owe you anything and can just go do something more fun instead. So it is not necissarily wrong to be mad, it just will not help you achieve your goal. Furthermore, it will hurt future efforts if you have bad relationships with the people you are trying to collaborate with!

When people collaborate well together, a bunch of factors usually come together. *They trust each other.* Everyone knows that the others are doing their best to make something cool. *They are having fun!* Almost everyone working on open source is doing it for fun. Things go faster and work better when you feel good about the process. **So it just works better to give others the benefit of the doubt and to not take things too seriously.** Open source goes faster when it is fun and friendly!
