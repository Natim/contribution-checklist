# Expectations

The easiest way to have more fun in open source is to know what to expect from
the process!


## “Simple” Problems

Things are more complex than they look in 90% of cases. In a large project,
a “simple” change may be related to other pieces that you have never seen
before. If your issue really is simple, it will be resolved pretty quickly.

When something “simple” is taking a long time, it probably means:

  1. It is more complicated than it seems.
  2. To explain why it is complicated may take longer than just fixing it.
  3. The overall prioritization of work across the entire project means that
    “the best option” is to circle back to the issue at a later date.

So things can hibernate for a bunch of reasons, but do not get discouraged! It
seems that this is a natural part of The Process, and the best thing to do is
to try something else until it is unblocked!


## Results

New folks usually think that success means “we solved it in 5 minutes”.
That is fun and amazing when it is possible, but lots of times it cannot be
that way. It is almost always more complex than that, so it is better to
think of contributions as part of The Process, not as a a standalone event.

  * If you are creating an issue and followed [the checklist](issues.md), you
    made a successful contribution to The Process. An issue must be *known*
    before it can be fixed!

  * If you made a PR that got stuck for some reason, you explored an
    implementation strategy. Maybe it wasn't the right one or it wasn't the
    right time for it, but this happens in The Process. If you view a PR as
    a learning opportunity for yourself and the community, this is an
    obviously valuable part of The Process.

  * If you have a design idea or feature request that does not get implemented,
    welcome to the club ;) A good maintainer is throwing away maybe 95% of
    their *own* ideas. To make excellent APIs, you probably want to go with the
    10th draft, but that would not exist without drafts 1 through 9! 

The Process includes all of these outcomes!


## Tone

It can be really frustrating when things are going slow. Maybe no one is
replying to you or things seem stalled in a review. 

Open source goes faster when it is fun and friendly, so just be nice!


If you are being nice, things are probably going as fast as possible. And
hopefully The Process will make “as fast as possible” a little bit faster!
