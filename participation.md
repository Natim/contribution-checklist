Issues and pull requests are treated more like a work queue than a discussion platform. It is usually better to talk through stuff in a [community forum][comm] and summarize it down into a clear idea before it becomes an issue.

Here are some rough guidelines to help keep things organized:


| If             | Then           |
|----------------|----------------|
| You have a similar [SSCCE][]. | Open a *separate* issue describing your case. If it is the same, the issues will be aggregated or we will just keep the best issue. If it is different, it will not get lost! |
| Your comment will broaden the scope of the issue. | Talk through your idea in a [community forum][comm] first. Probably open a separate issue. |
| You have a question. | Ask about it in a [community forum][comm]. |
| Your comment is long. | Is it possible to make it shorter? |
| An issue has 10+ comments. | It is probably time to close it and create a new issue that summarizes everything. |
